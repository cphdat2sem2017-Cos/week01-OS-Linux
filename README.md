#week 1 Linux, Webserver og MySQL in the cloud

##Day 1: Github and Linux on digital
###Github 
First you will get an introduction to how we are usinge [github](github.com) as a learning management system.

* Clone a repository  
* Create a repository on github  
* Clone your repository locally  
* Add, Commit, Push, Status


### Shell usage
In a bit we will need to connect to a linux machine. But to do so we need a "command prompt" or "shell". 

- For the window people, I recommend to download gitbash from https://git-scm.com/downloads
- For the mac people, I recommend to download from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/ and using the mac's standard terminal.


###Linux
We will look at how to set up a linux server on digitalocean, how to manage users on the machine, and how to navigate the server from the command prompt.

##Day 2: SSH & bash scripting
Using passwords to secure a server is considered insecure. Instead one use ssh-keys.
Also, we will take a look at bash-scripting to automate things on linux. In particular we will automate setting up a linux server with users for your group.

##Day 3: MySQL in the cloud
We will setup MySQL on the ubuntu server, set up users on MySQL with different rights, and work with SQL from the sql prompt. Also, we will connect to the server from MySQL Workbench and from our java program
